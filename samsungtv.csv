samsungtv,M K Raju,5,Worth every penny,Happy to see “made in india”on the box, yes this is completly made in india.

samsungtv,Manish B,4,Delightful,I want to thank Flipkart for seamless TV exchange experience. This is very different from the earlier impression while exchanging old product on Flipkart had challenges. Good improvement in this aspect, looks like Flipkart has taken people's feedback positively on exchange policy. My only little complain from Flipkart is the technician who came to install the TV didn't had good knowledge of TV function.Pros:Samsung crystal UHD TV picture quality is really outstanding.
